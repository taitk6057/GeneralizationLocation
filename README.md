Final project from an Applied Numerical Computing class

A MATLAB program to determine the location of points in a plane representing nodes in a wireless network given the location of other points with known positions representing nodes with GPS receivers, and inexact measurements via strength of signals of the distances between certain pairs of nodes

Successfully implemented using the Levenberg-Marquardt method
